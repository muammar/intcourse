Toulouse[^1] (French pronunciation: [tu.luz]), locally: [tuˈluzə] ; Occitan:
Tolosa [tuˈluzɔ], Latin: Tolosa, medieval Tholoza) is the capital city of the
department of Haute-Garonne, in southwestern France. It lies on the banks of
the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km
(143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean, and 580 km (360 mi) from Paris. With
1,202,889 inhabitants as of 1 January 2008, the Toulouse metropolitan area is
the fourth-largest in France, after Paris (12.1 million), Lyon (2.1 million),
and Marseille (1.7 million).  Toulouse is the centre of the European aerospace
industry, with the headquarters of Airbus, Galileo positioning system, the SPOT
satellite system, EADS, ATR and the Aerospace Valley, considered as a global
cluster.

The city also hosts l'Oncopole de Toulouse, the largest cancer research centre
in Europe, the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre
(CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, and Astrium
Satellites, EADS's satellite system subsidiary, also have a significant
presence in Toulouse. Its world renowned university is one of the oldest in
Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 119,000 students, is the
third-largest university campus of France after Paris and Lyon.  Toulouse
was the capital of the former province of Languedoc (provinces were abolished
during the French Revolution), the former Visigothic Kingdom and was the
capital of the historical region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the
capital of the Midi-Pyrénées region, the largest region in metropolitan France.
A city with architecture typical of Southern France, Toulouse counts two UNESCO
World Heritage sites, the Canal Du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with
other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, designated in 1998 because of
its significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route.

## Universities in Toulouse

Toulouse has the third-largest student population in France after Lyon and
Paris with 119,000 students.

The University of Toulouse (Université de Toulouse), established in 1229, is
located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the
universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at
a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of
Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European
ideology—inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts—as society
began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church,
in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.

## How to get in

### By plane
Regular scheduled domestic and international flights arrive at [Blagnac airport](http://www.toulouse.aeroport.fr/) , 11 km west of downtown Toulouse.
Air France operates flights to/from Paris flight time of approximately 30
minutes, which are usually priced around €50 each way, if booked in advance.
There are also many flights to major European cities such as London, Munich,
and Frankfurt.

To get to the city from the airport, you can take the ["Shuttle Bus"](http://www.toulouse.aeroport.fr/airport/access-transport-car-park/access/public-transportation/navette-city-centre)
for €5.00 to either the main bus/train station, or the Jean Jaures or Jeanne
D'Arc metro stations in the city center. The journey takes 20 minutes and the
bus operates every 20 minutes. The ticket is also valid for transfers onto
other public city buses within 90 minutes of validation. Tickets can be
purchased from the desk in the airport or the driver. Another option is to take
bus 66 to the Patte D'Oie metro station. A taxi to the center should cost
€20-25.  [Sea-Lifts](http://www.sea-lifts.com/Airports/Toulouse-Airport.aspx)
operates transfers from the airport to the beach and ski resorts as well as
other, further out, destinations.  Departure/arrival hall for your flight can
be found out by searching for the flight number at the
[flight timetable](http://www.toulouse.aeroport.fr/en/passagers/infos-vols/liste-destinations).
It is usually cheaper to fly via Ryanair to Beziers or Carcassonne and then
take the train to Toulouse, rather than flying directly to Toulouse.

### By train
[SNCF](http://www.voyages-sncf.com/) is the national intercity train operator
in France. Cheap tickets can be purchased via [iDTGV](http://www.idtgv.fr/),
which offers tickets from Paris starting from €18.  Trains to Paris take 5-7.5
hours, trains to Bordeaux take 2 hours, and trains to Marseille take 4 hours.
The train station in Toulouse is centrally located.  To/from Barcelona and
Andorra Toulouse is one end of the train line through the Pyrenees (TER
Midi-Pyrénées line 22). This line passes through Ariège, and most trains end at
the capital Foix. However, 6 trains a day continue from Toulouse and Foix on to
Andorre-L'Hospitalet (the closest train station to Andorra) and
Latour-de-Carol, at which you can change trains towards Barcelona. The train to
Andorre-L'Hospitalet takes 3 hours, 30 minutes, and the full journey to
Barcelona takes about 7 hours (including the change at Latour-de-Carol) and
costs €30.  The schedule for the French train is on the Touristic Routes
section of the SNCF website, while the Spanish schedule can be found by looking
on the Rodalies de Catalunya page. The Catalan name of Latour-de-Carol is La
Tor de Querol as listed on the Rodalies webpage.  By car Major highways towards
Paris, Bordeaux, Marseille, Barcelona.

### By bus
Bus and metro terminal at the railway station.

Bus services to Spain, Belgium, Italy, and Portugal can be made through Alsa

## Getting around in Toulouse

### IMPORTANT: Bring a photography in order to get the transport card.

### Bus and metro

[Tisseo](http://www.tisseo.fr/) operates a network of bus, tramway and metro
lines throughout the city. The website features an online route planner as well
as maps and schedules. Bus tickets can be bought from the bus drivers for
€1.60. Note that most bus lines stop operating at 22:00, but some of the most
popular lines operate until 01:00. When purchasing tramway tickets at vending
machines, which are conveniently located at every tramway stop, keep in mind
that ticket dispensers accept French credit cards only (Carte Bleu), so if you
don't have one, get enough coins beforehand (banknotes aren't accepted either,
and change is hardly available even at the central metro stations).

A free shuttle bus circles the historic centre of the city throughout the day
on all days except Sunday. These buses are usually green and don't have set
stops, so if you see one, flag it down.

The metro is relatively small, there are two lines, one going east-west (line
A), and the other going north-south (B), but is modern and easy-to-use. The
metro operates from 05:00 until midnight (1:00 on Friday and Saturday nights).

### By car

You should avoid going downtown with a car, as parking spaces are limited. One
good option is to drive to a metro station just outside of of the center and
park there, then head downtown by metro.

### By bicycle

Rent a bike from any one of the 253
[Velo Toulouse](http://www.velo.toulouse.fr/) bike stations for €1.20 day. If
you do not return the bike to a station within 30 minutes, you will be charged
extra. You can use the bikes as many times as you like during the day after
paying the €1.20.  The tourist office provides maps of cycle lanes and cycle
tours of the city.
